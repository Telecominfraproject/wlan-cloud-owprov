# Sanity checks 

## downstream interfaces with a vlan need the matching upstream interface with vlan

## an ssid with enterprise encryption needs a radius server

## f you have not defined as many radios as a device has, we will warn you

## If you defined 2 radios bur your config does not use both radios in the interfaces for example.

## If you keys/certs do not match, we will fail the configuration.

## We will also report things that are entered but not in the schema.
