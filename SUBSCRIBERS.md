# Subscribers Architecture

## Overview
The goal is to provide multiple WISPs with access to a set of subscribers. All subscribers will fall in the default WISP and can be moved to any other WISP later. You can use the source IP to detect which WISP to select.
Entities can be generic entities when created OR WISP entities.
